# Digit_Recongnizer

Kaggle has a competition that you have to use computer vision to predict the number of hand written digits. There are two notebooks in this repository, the first one was my first CNN model. I was able to achieve a 98% accuracy on the competition. The second notebook, builds and improves on the first CNN model and achieves a 99% accuracy.
